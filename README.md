# Fast-Discord-Nuker

Made by Xyatt#6392

First you would need to scrape the members so go to "cmd" type python scrap.py then put your token go to the server put any word like "hi" then all id in members.json

then go back to "cmd" type 
go run . -t "token" -m ".nuke" -f "members.json"

example 

"go run . -t "Nzc2OTYxMzIyMTgwODA0NjQ5.X68fnw.bQQqztP0H3cae7U__f5HzUKrqeI" -m ".wizz" -f "members.json""
