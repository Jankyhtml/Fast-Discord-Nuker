beta release version for my discord nuker

basically lets you nuke a server if your a admin.

After your done downloading it go to cmd type

go get github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo

go get github.com/urfave/cli/v2

Made by Xyatt#6392

First you would need to scrape the members so go to "cmd" type python scrap.py then put your token go to the server put any word like "hi" then all id in members.json

then go back to "cmd" type 
go run . -t "token" -m ".nuke" -f "members.json"

example 

"go run . -t "Nzc2OTYxMzIyMTgwODA0NjQ5.X68fnw.bQQqztP0H3cae7U__f5HzUKrqeI" -m ".wizz" -f "members.json"
```
